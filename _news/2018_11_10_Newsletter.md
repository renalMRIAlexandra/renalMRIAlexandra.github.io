# Upcoming 3rd International Conference on Renal Imaging in Nottingham
 
We warmly invite you to join us at the upcoming 3rd International Conference on Renal Imaging at the East Midlands Conference Centre, University of Nottingham, UK. We will bring together scientists and clinicians from several disciplines to shape the future of renal functional imaging. We are looking forward to meet you; save the date: 15th-17th of October 2019!

# Upcoming MAGMA Special Issue: “MRI Biomarkers of Renal Disease”

As recently depicted in the News section of the homepage, we call upon you to submit your scientific manuscripts as soon as possible, but not later than July 1, 2019. Please indicate your contribution to this special issue in the cover letter: “For inclusion in the Special Issue on Renal MRI”.

This special issue is an initiative of Taskforce 1.2 Technical Recommendations on Clinical Renal MRI, and will also serve as a vehicle for the dissemination of the envisioned technical consensus papers under development. More details on the Task force webpage.

# Previous Plenary Prague Meeting

# Privacy Notice Updates

Last but not least, you will find an updated version of the renalMRI (PARENCHIMA) privacy notice attached. Please keep in mind, if you did not sign the privacy notice during the Prague Meeting, that you need to sign it, and send a copy of it back to privacy@renalmri.org (e.g. scan/picture of the privacy notice).
