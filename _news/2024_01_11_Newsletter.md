Dear renalmri.org Community,

Happy New Year! Cheers to an incredible year and new projects ahead!

- **Jose María Mora Gutiérrez (Pamplona, Spain) - New Vice-Chair of renalmri.org**

We had a great call for the 2024 Vice-Chair position with Iosif A Mendichovszky and Jose María Mora Gutiérrez, which is also reflected by the vote. It was a close call, however, with a lead of 55.7 %, we are happy to announce Jose María Mora Gutiérrez (Pamplona, Spain) as our new Vice-chair for renalmri.org. His expertise and dedication will undoubtedly bring valuable contributions to our team. 
Thank you for your participation, and congratulations to the winner!

- According to the **governance rotation**, Pim Pullens (Ghent, Belgium) will be Chair, and Alexandra Ljimani will be Past-Chair (Duesseldorf, Germany) for this year. With this, **special thanks** from renalmri.org go to Anna Caroli, who is leaving the Core team as Past-Chair. Her immense contributions to the advancement of renal MR imaging in recent years have been invaluable.
