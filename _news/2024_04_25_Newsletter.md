- Study group business meeting, Thursday, 09 May 16:00-17:00 SGT in Room 324

- To all trainees and SMRT members: Please submit your renal imaging ISMRM abstract to be considered for this year’s annual trainee competition that will be held at our business meeting.  Deadline for submission (by alexander.daniel@nottingham.ac.uk) is Monday 29/4. Finalists will be notified by May 1st. Please include a copy of your abstract along with the abstract program number and title in the body of the email.
