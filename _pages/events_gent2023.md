# Location and Travel

## City of Ghent/Gent, Belgium

Ghent is home to various educational institutions, research centres and knowledge clusters and is simply a nice place to organise a conference: hospitable, charming, historical, sustainable and innovative.  In short, a city on a human scale.

As a result, discovering Ghent on foot or by bike is an absolute must! It is a city on a human scale, easily navigable by pedestrians.
